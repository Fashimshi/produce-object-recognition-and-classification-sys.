Loading and preprocessing
The dataset contains images of fruits and vegetables, which will be loaded and preprocessed to prepare them for training the CNN model. This involves resizing the images, converting them to grayscale, and scaling the pixel values.

## Load the Images with a generator and Data Augmentation
The images will be loaded using a generator and data augmentation techniques will be applied to the images to increase the size of the training set and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

## Train the model
A CNN model will be trained on the preprocessed data to classify the images of fruits and vegetables. The model will be trained using the training set and evaluated on the validation set.

## Visualize the result
The performance of the model will be visualized using graphs and metrics such as accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix.

## Class activation heatmap for image classification
Class activation heatmap technique will be used to identify which regions of the input image were important for the model's classification decision.

## Deploy the model
Finally, the trained model will be deployed to streamlit for use in classifying new images of fruits and vegetables.

For more details on the implementation, please refer to the code in the repository.
